###  `eda_communities.ipynb`
---
Contains code for EDA on population. Graphs used in the report are labelled with the heading "Used In Report". Simply run the notebook to generate graphs and statistics are printed in the outputs.

###  `model.ipynb`
---
Contains the code for the linear regression model for population, and code to generate the population predictions for 2024. The sections in order are: preprocessing for the model, model training, predictions, null and baseline models to compare against. Simply run the notebook to generate the graph and RMSE values.

###  `model_sensitivity_[removed_feature].ipynb`
---
Each file contains a modified regression model with a feature removed for sensitivity analysis. For each model it outputs the new RMSE value.

###  `eda1.ipynb`, `eda2.ipynb`
---
These two files contain some initial EDA analysis I did on the datasets. They are less important because the results are not used in the final report.
